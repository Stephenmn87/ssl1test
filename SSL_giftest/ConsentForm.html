<p>Title of Project: Social learning</p>

<p>Researcher name: Stephen Nei and Pauline Vorjohann</p>

<p><b>Invitation and brief summary:</b>
You are invited to take part in an experiment as part of an ongoing project investigating how people use information to make better guesses. Partaking in the experiment should require between 5 and 10 minutes. Please take time to consider the information carefully and to discuss it with family or friends if you wish, or to contact the researcher with questions. Thank you for your interest.
</p>

<p><b>Purpose of the research:</b>
The goal of this project is to better understand how people use information in social settings.
</p>

<p><b>Why have I been approached?</b>
You have been approached because you have indicated a willingness to participate in studies on this platform.
</p>

<p><b>What would taking part involve?</b>
As part of the experiment, you will be shown marbles drawn from a virtual bag that has been randomly filled with orange and green marbles, after which you will be asked questions about the contents of the bag. You will then see additional information about the bag after which you will have the chance to purchase the right to improve your guess. There will also be a short survey. Your answers to certain questions will be used to determine any bonus payments. After bonus payments are determined, all data collected will be anonymised so that no one, including the researchers, will be able to identify which answers you gave to any question.
</p>

<p><b>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</b>
A better understanding of how people learn from each other can lead to improvements in society. The only direct personal benefit for you will be the monetary payments.
</p>

<p><b>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</b>
There are no anticipated disadvantages to taking part. However, should you find any part of the experiment upsetting, we will be available to answer any questions. You can also contact the University of Exeter Business School’s Director of Research Ethics, Dr. Adrian Bailey at a.r.bailey@exeter.ac.uk, or the University’s Research Ethics and Governance Manager, Gail Seymour at g.m.seymour@exeter.ac.uk.
</p>

<p><b>What will happen if I don't want to carry on with the study?</b>
You can stop taking part at any time without having to give a reason; simply leave the experiment.
</p>

<p><b>How will my information be kept confidential?</b>
The University of Exeter processes personal data for the purposes of carrying out research in the public interest. The University will endeavour to be transparent about its processing of your personal data and this information sheet should provide a clear explanation of this. If you have any queries about the University’s processing of your personal data that cannot be resolved by the research team, further information may be obtained from the University’s Data Protection Officer by emailing informationgovernance@exeter.ac.uk. or at http://www.exeter.ac.uk/ig/
Your answers will be stored on University-owned servers with password protection. After the monetary payments has been determined, all personal identifiers will be removed from the dataset and the data made anonymous. The anonymised research data will be used for the purposes of writing a research report. In the interests of academic transparency, the anonymised data will be stored on the University of Exeter’s Open Research Exeter (ORE) online repository and made available for replication purposes. The outcomes of the research project in the form of research paper(s) will be made available on our professional websites
</p>

<p><b>Will I receive any payment for taking part?</b>
You will be paid a base payment for participation in the study. Additionally, you may receive an additional bonus payment depending on your answers and luck during the study. You will be asked to provide a guess about the contents of a bag filled with coloured marbles, as well as to make several additional choices.
</p>

<p><b>What will happen to the results of this study?</b>
The results of the study will be written up as an academic report and published in an academic journal. The academic report will also form the basis of presentations made at academic conferences. The anonymised data will be stored in the ORE online repository to allow for replication and to ensure academic transparency. The academic report will be made available on our professional websites. You can also contact us directly via email to enquire about any aspect of the study.
</p>

<p><b>Who is organising and funding this study?</b>
The sponsor for this study is the University of Exeter. Funding is from the British Academy.
</p>

<p><b>Who has reviewed this study?</b>
This project has been reviewed by the Research Ethics Committee at the University of Exeter (Reference Number XXXX).
