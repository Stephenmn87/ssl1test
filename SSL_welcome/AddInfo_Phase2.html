<p>
    The picture above shows each step of the study. You are at the blue star. In a moment, you will be asked how valuable you think the additional information will be BEFORE you are shown the information and BEFORE you know the price the computer has chosen to use your second guess to determine your bonus.
</p>
<p>
    You have been paired with a participant from a previous round of the study. That participant experienced almost the same problem you do. They were shown 4 marbles drawn from the same jar you face. They then guessed which jar was chosen. They were asked how valuable they expected the additional information to be BEFORE seeing the additional information. AFTER seeing the additional information, they made a second guess about the jarâ€™s contents.
</p>
    <p>
        The PREVIOUS PARTICIPANT you have been paired <strong>received ONE (1) more marble drawn from the jar as their additional information. They also learned at the end of their session that the maximum number of tokens they had reported they were willing to pay to use their second guess was greater than the price chosen by the computer.</strong>
    </p>
<p>
    The additional information YOU will receive is the second guess of this previous participant.
