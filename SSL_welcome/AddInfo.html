<p>
    The picture above shows each step of the study. You are at the blue star. In a moment, you will be asked how valuable you think the additional information will be BEFORE you are shown the information and BEFORE you know the price the computer has chosen to use your second guess to determine your bonus.
</p>
    <p>
        The additional information you will see is ONE (1) more marble drawn from the same jar. Along with the first 4 marbles you have already seen, you will have observed 5 marbles drawn from the jar in total.
