    <p>
        Two jars each have 100 marbles that are either <font color="orange">orange</font> or <font color="purple">purple</font>. One jar (the “<font color="orange">ORANGE</font>” jar)
        has {{C.MAJ}} orange marbles and {{C.MIN}} purple marbles. The second jar (the “<font color="purple">PURPLE</font>” bag) has {{C.MIN}} orange marbles and
        {{C.MAJ}} purple marbles.
    </p>

    <p>
        A fair coin flip has determined which one of the two jars has been chosen for you. Your task is to guess which jar was chosen.
    </p>

    <p>
        To help you guess, you will be shown marbles drawn from the jar.  Each marble will be returned to the jar immediately after being shown to you.
